gemify.js
=========

A script to aid in the gemification of items.

Just copy paste the stuff into your JS console in the browser. And tada, press the 'Gemify Multiple' button, make your selections by clicking on the items and then press 'Gemify Selections' and it will gemify them and refresh your browser.
